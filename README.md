# Selenium Python Project

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium with Python for web automation(index.py). Follow the steps below to set up the necessary environment and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Selenium script, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **pip**: Ensure pip (Python's package installer) is installed. Pip usually comes with Python. You can check by running:
   ```sh

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install selenium

pip install webdriver-manager

pip install python-dotenv


python your_script.py   #to run the .py file
